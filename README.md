Generating pages to print with words for the Hat Game.

See the website here: https://mishaiomdin.github.io/hatwords/

## Hat Game
The point of the game is to **explain** as many words as possible to a partner during limited time (e.g. 25 seconds).

In my experience, the rules are:
* only verbal explanation is allowed
* words from the same word family as the target word are NOT allowed
* talking about the word's length or letters is NOT allowed
* translation into other languages is NOT allowed
* etc.

## Using the website
Use the website to generate and print PDF files with randomly chosen words from a dictionary (Russian or English). Features include: word complexity, font size, text color etc.
